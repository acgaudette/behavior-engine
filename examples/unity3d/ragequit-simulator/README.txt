This example utilizes simple logic and outputs to the console using the Unity boilerplate.
While fun, its purpose is to demonstrate usage of the API, not to do anything advanced with the framework.

Setup:

  1. Create a blank scene
  2. Add an empty object
  3. Add two components to the empty: ComponentManager and Forum
  4. Open the console
  5. Press play
