On Year 82 in the Third Epoch, a derelict Kirisame-class freighter was found drifting near Sector 9 of the E332 system. The craft was unlisted on any known register.

During a routine investigation by safety craft from the nearest station, several bodies were discovered, as well as a curious tape hidden within a midship conference room.

The tape was found to contain grainy, choppy footage from what appeared to be a hidden camera mounted in the conference room. There was no audio.

The following is a transcript recorded manually by an employee from the local branch of the DIA while watching this footage.
