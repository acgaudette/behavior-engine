On the third rotation, Epoch 5, a derelict K-class freighter was found drifting near E202 (Sector 9). The craft was unlisted on any known register.

During a routine investigation by safety craft from the nearest station, several bodies were discovered, as well as a curious tape hidden within a midship conference room.

The tape was found to contain grainy, choppy footage from what appeared to be a hidden camera mounted in the conference room. There was no audio.

The following is a transcript recorded manually by a local DIA employee while watching this footage.
